## React, Security, & Full-Stack Auth with Node and PostgreSQL

The offical code for the *React, Security, & Full-Stack Auth with Node and PostgreSQL* course on Udemy by David Katz.

This course will turn you into a React and Web Security Developer and Engineer.

The best way to truly understand how web security and React align is to jump right into the code. This course will provide you with the fundamental theory. But, you will dive into coding examples as soon as possible to get your hands dirty with security.

In addition, authentication is often a tedious process when building any React application. So this course will take you through code that can apply to any project to add a full system of authentication (signing up, logging in, and more).

Some of the main course highlights:
- Understand various cyber attacks: XSS, CSRF, Broken Authentication, and more.
- Implement a full system of authentication in a React application.
- Build React Components with Vulnerabilities.
- Explore Cross-Site Scripting in code.
- Compare dangerous JavaScript methods and practices in code.
- Grasp the history of React in response to Security.

### A couple months after the initial release, this course introduced a section on full-stack authentication.

**Why do I need to know about React, Security, and Full-Stack Authentication?**

React, Security, and Authentication are core pillars to modern web application development.

If you are a software engineer focusing on web development, you will definitely need across React. As you continue building applications with the framework, eventually, you will have to allow users to sign up, and log in to your system.

**Why should I care about security?**

As users give you confidential information such as their passwords, you need to make sure your application is built in a secure way. This is why you need to study the best security practices for React and JavaScript development. You need to make sure your components don’t have any weaknesses that could expose your users’ data to the many bad sailors on the seas of the Internet.

**What if I only need to add authentication to my existing React application?**

If your goal is to purely add authentication to your existing React application, this course will take you through adapting a React application on top of an authentication service called auth. With this example, you will be able to add authentication to a React application whenever you need to.

**Why does this course teach full-stack authentication if there are existing authentication services?**

Knowing how authentication works as a whole will be vital for your career as a software engineer. At the core of any modern software project is the system that builds its users. Even if you only plan to create the frontend components that support authentication, your knowledge of how the backend works will help you design your code more efficiently. Plus, even if you’re using a great authentication service like auth0, there will always come a time when your application really scales and you need more room for customization. Therefore, having full control of your own authentication backend will be massively beneficial.

**Can I start with the full-stack authentication project?**

Yes, you can start with the full-stack authentication project. If you’ve already gone through the React and Security sections, this will definitely enhance your learning with the full-stack project. However, the full-stack project is built in a way that is not necessarily dependent on the previous course sections.

**Can I also use the full-stack project with an existing React app?**

Certainly, the backend from the full-stack project is built to support not only React, but any frontend that can make web requests.

**What technologies will we use on the backend and the frontend?**

We’ll use PostgreSQL to manage the database, and NodeJS to create the api and server. For the frontend technologies, we'll use ReactJS, and a couple React frameworks.
