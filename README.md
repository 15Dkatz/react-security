This course will turn you into a React and Web Security Developer and Engineer.

The best way to truly understand how web security and React align is to jump right into the code. This course will provide you with the fundamental theory. But, you will dive into coding examples as soon as possible to get your hands dirty with security.

In addition, authentication is often a tedious process when building any React application. So this course will take you through code that can apply to any project to add a full system of authentication (signing up, logging in, and more).

Some of the main course highlights:
- Understand various cyber attacks: XSS, CSRF, Broken Authentication, and more.
- Implement a full system of authentication in a React application.
- Build React Components with Vulnerabilities.
- Explore Cross-Site Scripting in code.
- Compare dangerous JavaScript methods and practices in code.
- Grasp the history of React in response to Security.

### The course also includes a full-stack authentication project.
This includes Node, PostgreSQL, and React for a full-stack web application that creates user accounts and sessions.
